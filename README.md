# WordPress ChatGPT plugin

This plugin adds a ChatGPT chatbot to your WordPress website. The chatbot can answer questions about the website content.

After installation, the OpenAI API key can be added to the settings page of the plugin (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_gpt_settings`) or to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
